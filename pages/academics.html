	    			<h1>DEPT. COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
	    			<p>
	    				The purpose of Computer Science degree programs is to produce computer scientists, who can form the backbone of the rapidly growing computer industry. The BS program is focused on developing an in depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science through a rigorous course work spanning over a period of four years. Students are given unique opportunities to go beyond traditional computer science and get themselves involved in research activities through various research and industrial collaboration programs carried out at the campuses. This ensures a broad based educational foundation that prepares them for leadership roles along diverse career paths.

	    			<h1>DEPT. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING</h1>
	    			<p>
	    				Faculty of Electrical Engineering of FAST – NU has designed the curriculum in order to meet the challenges of today’s competitive job market. The curriculum is updated frequently to facilitate the latest changes in the field and benefit the students, directly. The program is aimed at the students with the passion for the field, mostly on the practical side.
	    			</p>
	    			<p>
						The Electrical Engineering degree is based on the HEC/PEC approved curriculum. In the first year the students learn the fundamentals of Electrical Engineering supported by essential mathematics and physics courses. These courses are followed by breadth courses which introduce students to different specialties in Electrical Engineering. In their senior year students choose a specialization stream and study advanced courses. Currently specializations are being offered in two areas: Telecommunication Engineering, and Computer Engineering.</p>
						<p>In the highly competitive job market a young engineer is not only required to be knowledgeable in technical areas but is also expected to have excellent communication and managerial skills and an appreciation of modern day economics to design and implement a cost effective engineering solution. Students are offered courses in:</p>
						 
						<ul>
						<li>Communication skills</li>
						<li>Engineering management</li>
						<li>Economics</li>
						</ul>
						 
						<p>These courses are intended to prepare the students for any challenging environment. Social Science electives and courses in Professional Ethics contribute in enhancing the soft skills and help prepare a well-rounded personality. The course work is supported by state of the art engineering labs. During four years, students work in twelve different labs where they perform experiments using versatile equipment and simulation software.</p>
						<p>
						Apart from the practical sides of affairs, the curriculum also facilitates the students with interest in research. The students also learn from the faculty the art of converting research into education. The faculty of Electrical Engineering of FAST – NU comprises of experienced and talented individuals with specializations from all over the world. They strive hard to deliver their knowledge and provide quality education to the students.

	    			<h1>DEPT. MANAGEMENT SCIENCES</h1>
	    			<p>
	    				Change is the only constant known today to the business world which has to grapple with the challenging realities of an increasingly global and complex marketplace. The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) program at FAST attempts to bring out dynamic managers and administrators, well-equipped to meet the challenges posed by this highly competitive global marketplace. To this end, the approach in the classroom is tailored to inculcate an appreciation for both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of business. Quantitative skills developed through such areas as accounting, statistics, financial modeling and linear programming are combined with qualitative skills in communication, human psychology, marketing and organizational behavior. Using these diverse skills and tools, BBA graduates are expected to be able to provide timely solutions to real-world business problems – solutions that are cost-effective, efficient and ethically correct.</p><p>
						FAST School of Management is serving the needs of students from all over the Karachi, with graduates working in the key positions in the corporate sector of Pakistan. The School aims on delivering the best entrepreneurs to reshape the corporate sector of Pakistan for better. The curricula both of Bachelors and Masters are shaped to cater the needs of today’s market sector and to ensure that graduates of these fields have the knowledge and skill to lead and innovate to bring a steady and durable change in the corporate sector of the country.

	    			<h1>DEPT. SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES</h1>
	    			<p>
	    				The importance of Humanities subjects cannot be overlooked, even in the technical degrees like Computer Sciences and Engineering. “Humanities” is the genre of knowledge that provides the social and personal development skills. Every educated individual, regardless of their field of expertise, should have the basic knowledge of these social and personal development skills. Furthermore, traditional sciences play an important role in the logic building and problem solving skills. So Physics and Mathematics are crucial to the degree like Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering.</p><p>
FAST – NU doesn’t offer any degree in the fields of traditional sciences like physics, mathematics, etc. It also lacks in offering the degree in Humanities subjects like Psychology, Sociology, English Linguistics, etc. The department of Science and Humanities fills a major gap at NUCES. The department of Science and Humanities offers various courses for the students of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Business. Though this department does not yet offer any degree, but it offers courses for the students which are essential and necessary even in the world of cutting edge technology. Courses like Business Ethics, Psychology, Technology Management, English Composition, Islamic Studies, History of Pakistan and many other are offered yearly.</p><p>
Courses offered by this department serve as providing a “different” kind of knowledge to the students who are mostly technical aspects oriented. This helps to galvanize their learning circle and broaden their horizons by providing a unique content which can be blended with technology to produce substantially innovative ideas.
